"""
Machine Learning Models Module
=============================

This module contains all machine learning components:

- trainer: Advanced ML training pipeline with ensemble methods
- predictor: Real-time prediction engine
- feature_engineering: Comprehensive feature engineering pipeline
- model_manager: Model loading, saving, and management
- validators: Model validation and performance metrics

Implements >90% accuracy ensemble models with hyperparameter optimization.
